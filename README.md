# IT-Strategy-Project


J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is an American department store chain with 865 locations in 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. JCPenney has been an internet retailer since 1994. Despite being an early player in the e-commerce platform, a few strategic changes in its business and operations resulted in a decline in sales and stock value. We want to look at the strategic changes made within the company and how IT can make a difference in the way the business functions in the future accommodating the increased pace at which todayâ€™s market shifts and ultimately make more revenue as they are at the brink of bankruptcy.
